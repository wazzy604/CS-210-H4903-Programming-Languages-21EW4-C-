How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

One of the projects that I worked on for the C++ course was creating a clock. The clock designed and created must allow the user to view a 12-hour and a 24–hour clock, instead of just a 12 – hour clock.  There must also be two clocks simultaneously running instead of 1. 1 of the 2 clocks should be in a 12–hour format, and the other needs to be in a 24-hour format. I made sure to read the functional requirements and to understand what needed to be implements and built. I also reviewed the flow chart carefully to understand what the expectation is. I can revise my code to improve on various parts of the code to help to clarify the code. I can also add more comments to better the code. Modifying the code for the various reasons can improve my code and clarify it. It will also make the code more efficient since it will decrease the line of codes needed. When working on this assignment it was challenging to siphon the flow chart and requirements to understand and design the code to exact expectation. It was challenging to initially design a 12-hour clock but the 24- hours clocks took longer than expected. When I had a hard time to finish the 24-hour clock I couldn’t figure out how to do this, I started searching online. I also asked for help from the developers that I work with. They broke it down for me to understand it better to complete this assignment. The biggest skill that I can move forward with that I learned in this class is to combine various languages when needed. I learned to use various languages using Visual Studio to create a project. I added comments and made the code simple to understand for anyone that looks into the code.
